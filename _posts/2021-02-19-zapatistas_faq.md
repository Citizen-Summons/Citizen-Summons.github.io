This is an on-going project to try to answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about the Zapatistas/EZLN.

In case you haven't found an answer to your question, please send us an email and we will try our best to provide an answer and keep this FAQ growing.

# Name
Zapatista comes from Emiliano Zapata, a prominent figure of the Mexican Revolution and the commander of the Liberation Army of the South. Together with Pancho Villa (commander of the Northern Division), Zapata entered the National Palace where they argued about who should sit down in the Presidential Chair (only for a photo op as neither wanted to be president). Zapata refused to sit on the chair because he believed the chair corrupted people.

The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, EZLN) are armed members, but Zapatistas usually refers to both EZLN members and non-armed members.

# Origin (1994)
As NAFTA (January 1st 1994) goes into effect, the EZLN rises up in arms and take 7 municipalities.
