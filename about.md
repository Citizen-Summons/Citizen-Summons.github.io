*"We want a world where many worlds fit..."*

We are a collective based in Bonn, Germany, where all our members are adherents to the [Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle](https://enlacezapatista.ezln.org.mx/sdsl-en/), and we follow the seven organizational principles of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation ([EZLN](http://www.congresonacionalindigena.org/what-is-the-cni/)) and the National Indigenous Congress ([CNI](http://www.congresonacionalindigena.org/what-is-the-cni/)) of Mexico:

 * To obey, not command
 * To represent, not supplant
 * To serve others, not serve oneself
 * To convince, not defeat
 * To work from below, not go above
 * To propose, not impose
 * To build, not destroy


If you also agree with those words, please consider joining us. Or let us know about any organizations or people in your community whose efforts should be highlighted, we'd love to amplify their stories.
