We are "simple and humble people who resist and rebel against injustices all over the world", we are adherents to the [Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle](https://enlacezapatista.ezln.org.mx/sdsl-en/).


We want to give voice to the voiceless and help people connect with their communities.

If you know any organizations or people in your community whose efforts should be highlighted, we'd love to amplify their stories.
