# Welcome!

We are a collective based in Bonn, Germany, where all our members are adherents to the [Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle](https://enlacezapatista.ezln.org.mx/sdsl-en/) and these are the 13 just demands for everyone we support:

* work
* land
* shelter
* food
* health
* education
* independence
* freedom
* democracy
* justice
* peace
* information
* culture

*"[Everything for everyone...](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/zapatistas-lecciones-de-auto-organizaci%C3%B3n-comunitaria-en/)"*

Currently we're working on the following projects:

* **Samir Vive:** an ongoing art and multimedia project to honor the life and practice of Samir Flores Soberanes, a journalist and environmental activist who was murdered for defending the land and water of his community Amilcingo in Morelos, Mexico. Samir Lives, the struggle continues. Find out more [here](/samir_vive).
